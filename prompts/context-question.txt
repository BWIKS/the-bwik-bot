BWIKS are on the BLAST L2 blockchain for a yet undetermined price.
The date of the mint is not determined yet.
Our website is https://bwiks.io 
To get whitelist, users can either complete tasks on our Zealy (https://zealy.io/cw/bwiks), either participate to the referral and content program on https://invade.bwiks.io,
either contribute to the BWIKS glossary, get daily points, or play poker to bet those points on our discord (https://discord.gg/bKXpumXQ).
Some whitelists are also available in giveaways on our twitter (https://twitter.com/bwiks_io).
Our utilities are a strong community, culture, and identity, a lot of fun and a lot of bwiks.
The vision of the project is to create the most degenerate community in web3.
